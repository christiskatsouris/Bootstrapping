# Applications of Bootstrap Method

Applications of statistical theory and methods have positive spillover effects in the job market, especially in technology companies, financial institutions and other organizations. In particular, Applied data science has a broad scope of data science which includes researching new applications of data science and creating new methods or functions for faster retrieval of data and analysis. Applied data scientists have higher and deep technical knowledge of how data science and its methods work as compared to data scientists. Similarly, our role as econometricians and statisticians is to improve current understanding of existing methodologies and procedures.

In this teaching page we present some key applications of the bootstrap resampling method for statistical inference purposes in time series regression models. In particular, the use of resampling in statistical inference goes back to Tukey (1958) and Efron (1979) while Freedman (1981) extended this idea to regression models. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the main idea of this useful tool for obtaining robust estimates of model parameters and test statistics. There are of course modelling environments especially under certain econometric conditions that a standard Bootstrap approach is not suitable, but this is beyond the scope of this teaching page. A related introductory book chapter on Bootstrap and related methods, can be found in Chapter 21 of Davidson, R. and MacKinnon, J. G. (1993).

# [A]. Bootstrap for Linear Time Series Regression Models

The main idea behind bootstrapping is to repeatedly draw samples with replacement from the data, compute the statistic of interest and generate the sampling distribution of the statistic. Furthermore, bootstrapping is easily programmed both in R and Matlab. In particular, the build-in function 'bootstrap' in R can be employed for constructing bootstrapped test statistics.


## Example 1

```R

# install the package Bootstrap
install.package("bootstrap")
library(bootstrap)

# to generate B=1000 bootstrap samples using the boostrap function we use

# number of boostrap
nboot = 1000

# call the bootstrap function
boot.mean = bootstrap( 1: dim(dat)[1], nboot, mean.diff, dat )

```

## Example 2

```R

# install the package coin
install.packages("coin")
library(coin)

tstat <- function(data)
{
  x    <- data[1:nEng, 2]
  y    <- data[(nEng+1):nrow(data), 2]
  tobj <- t.test(x, y)
  t    <- tobj$statistic 
  return(t)
}

bootstat <- function(data, indices) 
{
  d  <- data[indices,] # allows boot to select sample
  t  <- tstat(d)
  return(t)
}

b   <- boot(data=mice2, statistic=bootstat, R=nBoot)
p   <- length(which(b$t > b$t0)) / nBoot

```

## Example 3

```R

# Another simple bootstrapping example in R
# my.bootstrap function below implements bootstrapping with replacement

my.bootstrap <- function(x, nboot, theta, ...)
{
  data   <- matrix(sample(x, size = length(x) * nboot, replace = T), nrow = nboot)
  answer <- apply(data, 1, theta, ...)
  return( answer )
}

# loads data
data(faithful) 

# Extract the data from R
observed <- as.matrix( faithful$waiting )
hist(observed,prob=T,breaks=15) 

# Obtain 1000 bootstrap replicates of the sample mean
bootvals <- my.bootstrap( observed, 1000, mean ) 

# Histogram of the bootstrap replicates
hist(bootvals,prob=T) 

# Add the sample mean
abline(v = mean(observed),lwd=3) 

# Add estimate of bootstrap density
lines(density(bootvals,kernel="gaussian")) 

```

## Example 4 (Regression-based Bootstrap Application)

Consider the following regression-based bootstrap approach for resampling from the conditional distribution.

```R

install.packages("bootstrap")
library(bootstrap)

theta <- function(z, n1)
{
  answer <- mean( z[1:n1]) - mean( z[(n1+1):length(z)] )
  return( answer )
}

treated     <- c(94,197,16,38,99,141,23)
non.treated <- c(52,104,146,10,51,30,40,27,46)

bootvals <- bootstrap2(treated, non.treated, 1000, theta, n1 = 7)
hist(bootvals)

```

## Example 5

Consider the implementation of the following Residual and Wild Bootstrap Resampling Techniques.

```R

install.packages("evd")
install.packages("boot")
install.packages("resample")

library(evd)
library(boot)
library(resample)

Seed <- 14
set.seed(Seed)

n    <- 100
y    <- rnorm(n) #randomly generated response
x    <- rnorm(n) #randomly generated predictor

formula  <- y~x

ResidObj <- residual.boot(y~x, B=100, seed=Seed) # perform the residual bootstrap
WildObj  <- wild.boot( y~x, B=100, seed=Seed)    # perform the wild bootstrap

# residual bootstrap 95% CI for slope parameter (percentile method)
quantile(ResidObj$bootEstParam[,2], probs=c(.025, .975))

# bootstrap 95% CI for slope parameter (percentile method)
quantile(WildObj$bootEstParam[,2], probs=c(.025, .975))

```

## Remarks:

Notice that under the presence of nuisance parameters in regression models then resampling methods such as the bootstrap can be employed for estimation and inference purposes (such as in the case of threshold cointegration model e.g., either within a multivariate setting or in dynamic or non-dynamic panel data regression models). Although the mechanism for obtaining bootstrap random sequences remains the same as in the case of the standard bootstrap distribution approach, in regression models we also need to obtain the corresponding bootstrapped model estimates in order to obtain asymptotic approximations for nuisance parameters (e.g., such as the unknown threshold variable). A framework for estimation and testing in dynamic panel models with nonlinearities is proposed by Hansen, B. E. (1999).   

## Assignment 1  

Using the estimation and testing procedure proposed in the paper of Hansen, B. E. (1999) implement your own R code procedure with a suitable bootstrap reampling method for obtaining bootstrap model coefficient estimates, bootstrap estimation of the nuisance threshold variable as well as correspondoing confidence intervals for the Regime-Specific Threshold Regression model. Your estimations can be based on the 'invest' dataset (which includes the variables i,q,c,d) or a different suitable dataset of your choice which based on a related economic theory it can support the hypothesis of the presence of threshold effects.      

In particular, you can use the following part of the code for the estimation step of the model specification. Your assignment should include the functions for the bootstrap procedure, a detailed description of the econometric model and main intuition as well as indicative output from the simulation study such as graphical representation of the bootstrap distribution of the threshold variable as well as computational aspects such as executation time and the computational complexity based on the procedure proposed in the paper of Hansen, B. E. (1999).

```R

# Threshold Regression Model Estimation Step for Non-Dynamic Panel Data (see,  Hansen, B. E. (1999))

# function to obtain an estimate for the SSE measure
sse_calc <- function(y,x)
{
   e  <- y-x%*%qr.solve(x,y)
  out <- t(e)%*%e 
  return(out)
} 

thr_sse <- function(y,q,r)
{
        nq <- nrow(q)
        sse <- matrix(c(0),nq,1)
        for (qi in 1:nq)
         {
            if (r[1]==0)
            {
               rr <- q[qi] 
            }
            else 
            { rr <- rbind(r,q[qi])
            }
            rr <- as.matrix(sort(rr))
            xx <- cbind(xt,ct)
            
            for (j in 1:nrow(rr))
            {
                d <- (thresh < rr[j])
                xx <- cbind(xx,tr(cf*d))
            }
            sse[qi] <- sse_calc(y,xx)
        }
        sse
}

# [B]. Bootstrap for Conditional Heteroscedastic Time Series Regressions

## Example 2

Simulate a data generating process that corresponds to a stationary GARCH model using the code below:

```R

install.packages("fGarch")
library("fGarch")

# Garch parameters
alpha <- 0.07
omega <- 0.5
beta  <- 0.6

# Garch specification
fgspec <- garchSpec( model=list(alpha=alpha, omega=omega, beta=beta) )
fgsim  <- garchSim( spec=fgspec, extended=TRUE, n=100 )
series <- fgsim

# Series extraction
garch.values <- series$garch
sigma.values <- series$sigma
eps.values   <- series$eps

# Plotting sequences
ts.plot(garch.values)
ts.plot(sigma.values)
ts.plot(eps.values)

est.garch <- garchFit(formula = ~ garch(1,1), data = series[1:n], include.mean = FALSE, trace = F)
est.par   <- est.garch@fit$par[1:3]
innov     <- series[1:n]/est.garch@sigma.t

ts.plot(innov)

```

## Assignment 2  

Using the bootstrap procedure below, implemented in R, consider an appropriate test statistic Tn of your choice for which you can employ as a structural-break detector when testing for the presence of parameter instability in a Garch (1,1) model.  Simulate $B = 1,000$ DGPs based on sample sizes $n = {250, 500}$ and obtain separately the empirical size (under the null hypothesis of no parameter instability) and the power function (under the alternative hypothesis) of your test statistic. Report the empirical size, empirical power and provide a detailed description of how you estimate the critical values of the test statistic. 

```R

set.seed(1234)

bootstrap.step <- function( innov = innov, B = B, n = n, n.s = n.s, est.par = est.par )
{#begin of function
  
  t.stat <- rep(NA, times = B)
  # Store the test statistics calculated from the B time bootstrap
  
  for (i in 1:B)
  {#Begin of bootstrap step
    
    # Bootstrap Innovation
    e.tilde <- sample(innov,size=(n+n.s), replace = T)
    # Recursive Bootstrap Sample
    # Initial Values: s.boot=unconditional variance estimate
    
    s.boot <- rep(NA, times = n+n.s)             # Bootstrap sigma
    x.boot <- rep(NA, times = n+n.s)             # Bootstrap x
    
    if ( (est.par[2] + est.par[3]) < 1 )
      s.boot[1] <- est.par[1] / ( 1 - est.par[2] - est.par[3] )
    if ( (est.par[2] + est.par[3]) >= 1 )
      s.boot[1] <- var(innov)
   
   x.boot[1] <- sqrt(s.boot[1])*e.tilde[1]
   for (j in 2:(n+n.s))
    {
      s.boot[j] <- est.par[1] + est.par[2]*(x.boot[j-1])^2 + est.par[3]*s.boot[j-1]
      x.boot[j] <- sqrt(s.boot[j])*e.tilde[j]
    }
    
    x.boot    <- x.boot[(n.s+1):(n.s+n)]
    t.stat[i] <- T_hat(x.boot)
    
    #T_hat is the function for the test statistic (under the null hypothesis there is no volatility shift)
  }#end of bootstrap step
  
  return(t.stat)
  
}#End of function

# [C]. Block Bootstrap Techniques

In this section, we demonstrate some useful examples related to Block Bootstrap techniques. 

## Example 3

Consider the following coding procedure in R which checks for the block-length for the implementation of the block bootstrap resampling approach. 

```R

set.seed(1234)

# Check block-length of subsamples
  if (is.null(sub_sample)) 
  {
    m <- round(n^(1 / 5) * n^(1 / k))
  } 
  else if (sub_sample >= n) 
  {
    stop("sub_sample must be less than series length")
  } 
  else
  {
    m <- round(sub_sample)
  }

```

Then, we can call the function 'tsbootstrap' in order to implement the block-bootstrap resampling method. 

```R
# Bootstrap variance of whole series
boot_temp <- tseries::tsbootstrap(series,
                                  statistic = stats::var,
                                  type = "block",
                                    nb = nb,
                                     b = l_star,
                                     m = bofb )
                                     
>  boot_temp

Call:
tseries::tsbootstrap(x = series, nb = nb, statistic = stats::var, 
    m = bofb, b = l_star, type = "block")

Resampled Statistic(s):
  original       bias std. error 
   1.28219   -0.01976    0.13802 

# Save updated variance of whole series
v_star <- mean(boot_temp$statistic)
        
```

# Historical Background

$\textbf{David Freedman}$ (5 March 1938 â 17 October 2008) was Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a distinguished mathematical statistician whose wide-ranging research included the analysis of martingale inequalities, Markov processes, de Finetti's theorem, consistency of Bayes estimators, sampling, the bootstrap, and procedures for testing and evaluating models. He published extensively on methods for causal inference and the behavior of standard statistical models under non-standard conditions â for example, how regression models behave when fitted to data from randomized experiments. Freedman also wrote widely on the applicationâand misapplicationâof statistics in the social sciences, including epidemiology, public policy, and law (Source: Wikipedia).
